# RGB-LED-Module-for-Olfactory-Assay-Arena

The RGB LED Module "Model 608 revC V1.0" is specifically designed for use with the "Olfactory Assay Arena" Revision C and enables precise optogenetic control in behavioral experiments. The board supports independent control of red, green, and blue high-power LEDs across four separate channels, as well as an independently controlled IR LED. It interfaces with an Arduino Mega 2560 via serial communication, using PWM and TTL signals for intensity and status regulation. Safety features and operational constraints ensure reliable use in a laboratory setting. A comprehensive command structure allows for highly flexible integration into custom research setups. This system is not approved for human use and is intended strictly for experimental laboratory environments.

## Reference
The RGB-LED module "Model 608 revC V1.0" was designed as a drop-in replacement for the original single-color LED module used in the “Olfactory Assay Arena – Revision C” developed by HHMI’s Janelia Research Campus.
